Algorithm      | Observed Behavior  | Big-O      | Evidence/Notes                              
---------------|------------------- |------------|---------------------------------------------
Linear Search  | Increases Linearly | O(n)       | Time taken is 2 more digits than sample size
Binary Search  | Barely Increases   | O(log n)   | Time take barely increase when sample x10   
Insertion Sort | Large increase     | O(n^2)     | Quick for small sample sizes                
Selection Sort | Large increase     | O(n^2)     | Slowest for all sample sizes                
Bubble Sort    | Large Increase     | O(n^2)     | Second Slowest for all sample sizes         
Merge Sort     | Grows Slowly       | O(n log n) | Slowest compared to other O(n log n) sorts  
Quick Sort     | Grows Slowly       | O(n log n) | Nearly Linear growth                        
Heap Sort      | Grows Slowly       | O(n log n) | Slightly faster than quick sort
